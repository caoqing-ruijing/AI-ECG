# AI-ECG
This repo is the official implementation of **"Deep Learning-based 12-lead Electrocardiogram for Low Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Detection in Patients"**. In this paper, we developed an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) algorithm to accurately and efficiently identify patients with low ejection fraction and estimate the precise left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value.
