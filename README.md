# [Deep Learning-based 12-Lead Electrocardiogram for Low Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Detection in Patients](https://github.com/hMango/AI-ECG/)
This repo is the official implementation of ["Deep Learning-based 12-Lead Electrocardiogram for Low Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Detection in Patients"](https://github.com/hMango/AI-ECG/). In this paper, we developed an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) algorithm to accurately and efficiently identify patients with low ejection fraction and estimate the precise left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value.
